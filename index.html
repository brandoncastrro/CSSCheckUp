            Here's something that's fun. That's what painting is all about. It should make you feel good when you paint. In painting, you have unlimited power. You have the ability to move mountains. Let's do that again. I'm going to mix up a little color. Weâ€™ll use Van Dyke Brown, Permanent Red, and a little bit of Prussian Blue.

            Just let go - and fall like a little waterfall. Remember how free clouds are. They just lay around in the sky all day long. It looks so good, I might as well not stop. Maybe we got a few little happy bushes here, just covered with snow. If these lines aren't straight, your water's going to run right out of your painting and get your floor wet. Now, we're going to fluff this cloud.

                Only eight colors that you need. Be careful. You can always add more - but you can't take it away. Working it up and down, back and forth. That's crazy. Just make a decision and let it go. We want to use a lot pressure while using no pressure at all.

                Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning. Just a little indication. In your world you can create anything you desire. A fan brush is a fantastic piece of equipment. Use it. Make friends with it.

                Work that paint. If it's not what you want - stop and change it. Don't just keep going and expect it will get better. Here's another little happy bush In life you need colors. I started painting as a hobby when I was little. I didn't know I had any talent. I believe talent is just a pursued interest. Anybody can do what I do.
    
                Mountains are so simple, they're hard. We don't really know where this goes - and I'm not sure we really care. We have no limits to our world. We're only limited by our imagination.
    
                Trees cover up a multitude of sins. A little happy sunlight shining through there. All those little son of a guns.
    
                Be careful. You can always add more - but you can't take it away. That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue. See there how easy that is. Isn't that fantastic that you can make whole mountains in minutes? It takes dark in order to show light.
    
                Zip. That easy. There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature. Let's put some happy little clouds in our world.
    
                Each highlight must have it's own private shadow. Every day I learn. Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas. There are no limits in this world. If there's two big trees invariably sooner or later there's gonna be a little tree. Don't fiddle with it all day.
